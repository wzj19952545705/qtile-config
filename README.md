# My qtile config

My config integrates with some self-written rofi scripts. It's divided into nine groups with one specially set for chemistry school study, as i'm a student majoring in chemistry.
This config may not be that functional as those of professional programmers, and may still
needs improvement, but so far it suits me fine enough.
